World Record Quiz

1. Ask the user 3 different questions one after another

2. Check if their answer is correct
    - Convert the input to lowercase to match the answer

3. Add up the point and returns the total score at the end

4. Ask the user if they want to play the quiz again.


Further improvements:
- Input answers
    -> At the moment, if the input is not literally the same as "Mount Everest", the answer is wrong.
    -> How to give the user a point when the input is similar or partly correct?
    (e.g. "Everest", "Mt. Everest", etc.)
